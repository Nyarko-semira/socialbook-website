I created a website called SocialBook using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features a sticky navigation bar that stays at the top of the page as users scroll, providing seamless access to key elements like a logo, interactive icons, a search box, and a clickable profile image.

The page layout is organized into three primary sections:

Left Sidebar: A fixed section for menus or shortcuts to improve navigation.
Main Content Area: The central column, which contains the scrollable, dynamic content.
Right Sidebar: Another fixed section for additional features.
This design ensures that while users scroll through the content in the main area, the sidebars and navigation bar remain static, offering a streamlined and user-friendly browsing experience. The project highlights my skills in responsive web design and effective layout management
